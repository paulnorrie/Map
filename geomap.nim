## Opening Geospatial Data
## -----------------------
## You must first ``#open`` the data (e.g. the file or database) you
## will work with.  This does not read the contents of the file, which means
## if it's a raster you can get information about it or use its geospatial
## reference data without loading the raster into memory.
## 

# Transformer types for transforming from world to raster coords

  
#proc initRaster(data, width, height, countBands, interleave, dataType)
# Initialising a raster with mandatory information so we don't have an incomplete
# raster info.
